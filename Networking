Intro to networking -NSL
Cat-5
RJ-11
Data-link layer -Layer2
Hex representation AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
Vendor-specific prefixes
Linux/Mac:ifconfig
Windows:ipconfig /all or getMAC on windows

ARP-Address Resolution Protocol

arp-a 

to ping -c 1 (IP address) -> admin required

ping (IP address)

IP addresses:
how computers see each other at Layer 3+

Decimal representation (eg 111.222.333.444) numbers only 0-255 (octet)

10.0.0.0/8 Class A private block
172.16.0.0/12 -> 16 Continguous Class B block


127 is for diagnostic testing 

classes: 
Class A: 1-126 
Class B: 128-191
Class C: 192-223
Class D: 224-239
Class E: 240-255

netmask

Modern CIDR

DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
DNS: Domain Name System

dig+trace google.com

nslookup google.com

whois google.com

Layer 4 -Transports(TCP/UDP)

TCP "packets" -> Rudimentary sessioning, Receipt acknowledged
UDP "datagrams" -> not acknowledged

TCP Connection Flow

OSI Model

Layers 5+

Almost always application controlled

Examles:
HTTP/HTTPS traffic
Web
FTP/SFTP
SSH

Switching Flooding
Switching Forwarding

Switching Broadcasts
VLANs-> unless router is involved, VLANs cannot talk to each other

Routing Static Routes

Wireshark:

Time to live: time before gives up

ARP poisoning

ip.dst_host==(host)

nmap -> port scanning
# shares
SMB: file sharing protocol in Windows

NTLM Authentication

HTTP: all text

HTTP headers/derivatives

GET / HTTP/1.1
GET -> type of request /->(main) HTTP/1.1 -> version
Host (website name)

traceroute (Windows)
traceip
ttl -> time to live

route-n (Linux)
route print
